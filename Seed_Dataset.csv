Query:Summarize issues similar to don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/0:issue/1,"We need to summarize issues similar to don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/0:issue/1 which we can see is an ID (a unique identifier for an issue) so we will first call the ""get_similar_work_items"" API with argument name : ""work_id"" and argument_value: ""don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/0:issue/1"" since we need to get similar issues. 

Next,   we will call the ""summarize_objects"" API with argument_name: ""objects"" and argument_value: ""$$PREV[0]"" since we need to then summarize the issues and we can refer the value of the ith chain using ""$$PREV[0]"". Therefore, the answer is: [(tool_name: get_similar_work_items, argument_name: work_id, argument_value: don:core:dvrv-us-1:devo/0:issue/1), (tool_name: summarize_objects), (argument_name: objects, argument_value: $$PREV[0]),]"
Query: Prioritize my P0 issues and add them to the current sprint,"To prioritize your P0 issues and add them to the current sprint, we need to perform the following steps using the provided APIs:

1. **Identify the User:** First, we need to identify who ""my"" refers to in the query. We will use the `who_am_i` API to get the ID of the current user.
   - Tool Name: `who_am_i`
   - Arguments: []

2. **List P0 Issues Owned by the User:** Next, we need to list all the P0 issues that are owned by the user. We will use the `works_list` API with three arguments:
   - Tool Name: `works_list`
   - Arguments: 
     - (argument_name: `owned_by`, argument_value: `$$PREV[0]`)
     - (argument_name: `issue.priority`, argument_value: `['p0']`)
     - (argument_name: `type`, argument_value: `['issue']`)

3. **Prioritize the Retrieved Issues:** Once we have the list of P0 issues, we need to prioritize them. We will use the `prioritize_objects` API with the list of issues obtained from the previous step.
   - Tool Name: `prioritize_objects`
   - Arguments: 
     - (argument_name: `objects`, argument_value: `$$PREV[1]`)

   - Tool Name: `get_sprint_id`
   - Arguments: []

5. **Add Prioritized Issues to the Current Sprint:** Finally, we will use the `add_work_items_to_sprint` API to add the prioritized P0 issues to the current sprint. We will use two arguments: the list of prioritized work IDs and the sprint ID.
   - Tool Name: `add_work_items_to_sprint`
   - Arguments: 
     - (argument_name: `work_ids`, argument_value: `$$PREV[2]`)

1. First, we need to identify the ID of the object (in this case, the customer ""UltimateCustomer"") using the `search_object_by_name` API. This is because we need the ID to filter tickets related to this customer. So, we will call `search_object_by_name` with the argument `(argument_name: query, argument_value: UltimateCustomer)`.

2. Next, we will use the `works_list` API to retrieve the list of high severity tickets related to ""UltimateCustomer."" For this, we need three arguments:

   - `(argument_name: ticket.source_channel, argument_value: $$PREV[0])` to filter tickets related to ""UltimateCustomer"" (using the ID retrieved from the previous step),
   - `(argument_name: type, argument_value: ticket)` to ensure we are only retrieving tickets.

3. Finally, we need to summarize the retrieved tickets. We do this by calling the `summarize_objects` API with the argument `(argument_name: objects, argument_value: $$PREV[1])`, where `$$PREV[1]` refers to the list of high severity tickets related to ""UltimateCustomer.""
